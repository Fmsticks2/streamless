# Architecture

Streamless consists of:

- Autonomous Smart Contract (ASC) on Massa for subscription logic and deferred calls
- DeWeb-hosted React frontend that interacts with the contract via Massa Web3 SDK
- Massa network as the execution layer for autonomous scheduling

See `deliverables.txt` for detailed architecture, data flow, and interfaces.
