# Contracts

This folder will contain the Streamless Autonomous Smart Contract (ASC) for Massa.

Two options are possible:
- AssemblyScript (recommended for quicker iteration)
- Rust (requires Massa-compatible toolchain)

See `deliverables.txt` smart_contract and deployment_plan sections for the full specification.
