/**
 * Deploys multiple smart contracts.
 *
 * This function will go through all provided smart contracts.
 * For each one, it will deploy the contract and call its constructor function with given arguments in the same
 * transaction.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Under the hood, this will generate a deployer smart contract with a main function.
 * This function will deploy your smart contract and call the constructor function if it has one.
 *
 * This generated deployer smart contract will then be ran by an ExecuteSC operation.
 *
 * You smart contract and the constructor function arguments are passed to the deployer smart contract via the operation
 * datastore of the ExecuteSC operation.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * The smart-contract information is stored in the operation datastore with the following structure.
 *
 * key [0] : Contains the numbers of SC to deploy
 *
 * key [0, 0, 0, 1]
 * ...
 * key [x, x, x, x]: contains the bytecode of each SC. The 4 bytes of the key is the index (in 4 bytes) of the
 * contract in the list of contracts to be deployed
 *
 * key [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * ...
 * key [x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 0, 0]: optional key that have the args for each contract
 *
 * key [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
 * ...
 * key [x, x, x, x, 0, 0, 0, 1]: optional key that have the coins for each contract
 *
 * @param publicApi - public API node URL
 * @param account - the wallet that will deploy
 * @param contracts - contracts and constructors arguments
 * @param fee - fees to provide to the deployment
 * @param maxGas - maximum amount of gas to spend
 * @param wait - waits for the first event if true
 * @param maxCoins - maximum amount of coins to spend (optional. if not set, we use the estimated value)
 *
 * @throws If error during the deployment
 *
 * @returns a promise that resolves to an `IDeploymentInfo` which contains the operation id and the events
